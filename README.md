## 🔥🚀 Home Assistant Deployment with Docker, Terraform, Cloudflare Tunnel, and Tailscale VPN 🔥🚀

Welcome to my open-source repository for my Home Assistant deployment! This project showcases my expertise in deploying Home Assistant on a self-hosted server using the latest tools and technologies.

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- Docker containers for efficient and scalable deployment
- Terraform for infrastructure management on my Proxmox datacenter
- Cloudflare Tunnel for secure access to my Home Assistant instance
- Tailscale VPN for easy and secure authentication to my private network
- GitHub Pipelines for automated testing and deployment

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning
I have used Terraform to automate the provisioning of the infrastructure on my Proxmox datacenter, including the virtual machines, network settings, and storage volumes.

### 🌐 Cloudflare Tunnel Automation
Cloudflare Tunnel is used for secure access to my Home Assistant instance from anywhere, without the need to expose any ports publicly. I have also automated the provisioning of the Cloudflare Tunnel using Terraform.

### 🔒 Tailscale VPN for Authentication
To ensure that only authorized users have access to my Home Assistant instance, I have implemented Tailscale VPN for authentication. This provides easy and secure access to my private network from anywhere in the world.

### 📈 GitHub Pipelines for Automation
I have used GitHub Pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of this project. This ensures that any changes made to the code are thoroughly tested and deployed to production in a consistent and reliable manner.
